    "Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or simply Neural networks is a supervised computational model inspired by how the human brain works. It consists of several computational nodes called Neurons interconnected to process and transmit information, similar to the way neurons in the human brain communicate with each other. Each neuron performs computation, the simplest being a logistic regression, and forwards the output to other neurons in the network. Through this structure, the neural network is able to leevrage on the power of combining several units of basic processing into a bigger, stronger and more accurate system.   "

    "Before we look at the architecture of a Neural Network, let's build intuition. Assuming we have the task of constructing a bridge. Such a nature of the task will require several specialties like architectural engineering, civil engineers, material scientists, etc. But we only have unskilled labor, meaning we must have to provide training for the workforce. Since there will be training anyway, we have three options: we can choose to pick one of the laborers and attempt to train them in all the required specialties, or we can choose to train all the workforce in all of the required specialties, and lastly, we can choose to divide the workforce into distinct specialties and have each group focus on a specific assignment. Which of these approaches will likely yield the optimal quality of the bridge?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you are correct. If we choose to go with option one, it would be almost impossible for that one person to pay attention to all the details of the specialties and not be overwhelmed. So this approach is not guaranteed to yield the best possible result. If we choose to stick with option two, then we will end up training a larger number of persons who are most likely going to be overwhelmed themselves and, in the end, not be able to grasp the details. With the last option, each person is learning the bits they need to deliver their task in the project to the best possible quality. Hence, approach three will most likely perform better. Approach number three is an analogy of the Artificial Neural Network. This is why Artificial Neural Network shines, especially when we have a large dataset to learn from.\n",
